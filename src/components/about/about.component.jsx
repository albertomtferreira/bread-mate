          Each breadstick is meticulously shaped and then carefully frozen to
          preserve their unique freshness. When you bake your breadsticks, you
          will be greeted with the delightful scent of warm, finest goodness,
          ready to transform into perfectly golden-brown masterpieces. Whether
          you succumb to the temptation of baking them immediately or stash them
          away in the freezer for a future gathering, each bite will transport
          you to a culinary haven. Enjoy the symphony of textures as the crispy
          exterior gives way to a soft, airy interior, infused with the
          irresistible flavors of homemade bread. For those who demand the
          ultimate indulgence, we offer an exclusive option: have your
          breadsticks baked to perfection before they arrive at your door. This
          premium service comes with an additional charge of Â£2.00 per pack,
          ensuring that your breadsticks are at their absolute peak of freshness
          and flavor. As you place your order, please indicate your preference
          for baked breadsticks. We'll carefully handle the baking process,
          ensuring that each breadstick emerges from the oven with a
          golden-brown hue and an irresistible aroma that will fill your home
          with warmth and delight.
